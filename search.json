    "text": "2. Write a Query Function\nIn the hw1.py file, write a function called query_climate_database() which accepts five arguments:\n\ndb_file, the file name for the database\ncountry, a string giving the name of a country for which data should be returned.\nyear_begin and year_end, two integers giving the earliest and latest years for which should be returned (inclusive).\nmonth, an integer giving the month of the year for which should be returned.\n\nThe return value of query_climate_database() is a Pandas dataframe of temperature readings for the specified country, in the specified date range, in the specified month of the year. This dataframe should have the following columns, in this order:\n\nNAME: The station name.\nLATITUDE: The latitude of the station.\nLONGITUDE: The longitude of the station.\nCountry: The name of the country in which the station is located.\nYear: The year in which the reading was taken.\nMonth: The month in which the reading was taken.\nTemp: The average temperature at the specified station during the specified year and month. (Note: the temperatures in the raw data are already averages by month, so you don’t have to do any aggregation at this stage.)\n\nHint: Inside the function, you would want to put in the given variables (like year_begin) inside the query string (like SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE ...). While you can do this with string concatenation, injecting variables with the fancy Python f-strings will make your code look cleaner. Be careful not to forget quotation marks for the string variables.\nAs a test case, run this example and check if you get the correct result:\nquery_climate_database(db_file = \"your_database_file.db\",\n                       country = \"India\", \n                       year_begin = 1980, \n                       year_end = 2020,\n                       month = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNAME\n\n\nLATITUDE\n\n\nLONGITUDE\n\n\nCountry\n\n\nYear\n\n\nMonth\n\n\nTemp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\nAGARTALA\n\n\n23.883\n\n\n91.250\n\n\nIndia\n\n\n1980\n\n\n1\n\n\n18.21\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nAGARTALA\n\n\n23.883\n\n\n91.250\n\n\nIndia\n\n\n1981\n\n\n1\n\n\n18.25\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nAGARTALA\n\n\n23.883\n\n\n91.250\n\n\nIndia\n\n\n1982\n\n\n1\n\n\n19.31\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nAGARTALA\n\n\n23.883\n\n\n91.250\n\n\nIndia\n\n\n1985\n\n\n1\n\n\n19.25\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nAGARTALA\n\n\n23.883\n\n\n91.250\n\n\nIndia\n\n\n1988\n\n\n1\n\n\n19.54\n\n\n\n\n…\n\n\n…\n\n\n…\n\n\n…\n\n\n…\n\n\n…\n\n\n…\n\n\n…\n\n\n\n\n3115\n\n\nVISHAKHAPATNAM\n\n\n17.717\n\n\n83.233\n\n\nIndia\n\n\n2016\n\n\n1\n\n\n25.09\n\n\n\n\n3116\n\n\nVISHAKHAPATNAM\n\n\n17.717\n\n\n83.233\n\n\nIndia\n\n\n2017\n\n\n1\n\n\n23.90\n\n\n\n\n3117\n\n\nVISHAKHAPATNAM\n\n\n17.717\n\n\n83.233\n\n\nIndia\n\n\n2018\n\n\n1\n\n\n22.65\n\n\n\n\n3118\n\n\nVISHAKHAPATNAM\n\n\n17.717\n\n\n83.233\n\n\nIndia\n\n\n2019\n\n\n1\n\n\n22.20\n\n\n\n\n3119\n\n\nVISHAKHAPATNAM\n\n\n17.717\n\n\n83.233\n\n\nIndia\n\n\n2020\n\n\n1\n\n\n23.75\n\n\n\n\n\n3120 rows × 7 columns"

    "text": "3. Write a Geographic Scatter Function for Yearly Temperature Increases\nIn this part, you will write a function to create visualizations that address the following question:\n\nHow does the average yearly change in temperature vary within a given country?\n\nWrite a function called temperature_coefficient_plot(). This function should accept six explicit arguments, and an undetermined number of keyword arguments.\n\ndb_file, country, year_begin, year_end, and month should be as in the previous part.\nmin_obs, the minimum required number of years of data for any given station. Only data for stations with at least min_obs years worth of data in the specified month should be plotted; the others should be filtered out. df.transform() plus filtering is a good way to achieve this task.\n**kwargs, additional keyword arguments passed to px.scatter_mapbox(). These can be used to control the colormap used, the mapbox style, etc.\n\nThe output of this function should be an interactive geographic scatterplot, constructed using Plotly Express, with a point for each station, such that the color of the point reflects an estimate of the yearly change in temperature during the specified month and time period at that station. A reasonable way to do this is to compute the first coefficient of a linear regression model at that station, as illustrated in the lecture where we used the .apply() method.\nFor example, after writing your function, you should be able to create a plot of estimated yearly increases in temperature during the month of January, in the interval 1980-2020, in India, as follows:\n# assumes you have imported necessary packages\ncolor_map = px.colors.diverging.RdGy_r # choose a colormap\n\nfig = temperature_coefficient_plot(\"India\", 1980, 2020, 1, \n                                   min_obs = 10,\n                                   zoom = 2,\n                                   mapbox_style=\"carto-positron\",\n                                   color_continuous_scale=color_map)\n\nfig.show()\n\n\nPlease pay attention to the following details:\n\nThe station name is shown when you hover over the corresponding point on the map.\nThe estimates shown in the hover are rounded to a sober number of significant figures.\nThe colorbar and overall plot have professional titles.\nThe colorbar is centered at 0, so that the “middle” of the colorbar (white, in this case) corresponds to a coefficient of 0.\n\nIt’s not necessary for your plot to look exactly like mine, but please attend to details such as these. Feel free to be creative about these labels, as well as the choice of colors, as long as your result is polished overall.\nYou are free (and indeed encouraged) to define additional functions as needed."

Create Two More Interesting Figures (Optional)\nCreate at least one more SQL query function in hw1.py and at least two more complex and interesting interactive data visualizations using the same data set. These plots must be of different types (e.g. line and bar, scatter and histogram, etc). The code to construct each visualization should be wrapped in functions, such that a user could create visualizations for different parts of the data by calling these functions with different arguments. At least one of these plots must involve multiple facets (i.e. multiple axes (in the sense of facets), each of which shows a subset of the data).\nAlongside the plots, you should clearly state a question that the plot addresses, similar to the question that we posed in Part 3. The questions for your two additional plots should be meaningfully different from each other and from the Part 3 question. You will likely want to define different query functions for extracting data for these new visualizations.\nIt is not necessary to create geographic plots for this part. Scatterplots, histograms, and line plots (among other choices) are all appropriate."
